[00:06.05] Gunter glieben glauten globen
[00:20.55] 
[00:08.14] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[00:12.89] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[00:16.14] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[00:19.81] And all the girls say I'm pretty fly or a white guy
[00:45.31] 
[00:33.69] Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis
[00:54.69] 
[00:36.05] You know it's kind of hard, just to get along today
[00:38.92] Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
[00:42.22] He may not have a clue and he may not have style
[00:45.74] But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial
[01:11.74] 
[00:49.08] So don't debate, a player straight
[00:52.44] You know he really doesn't get it anyway
[00:55.88] He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
[00:58.94] For you no way, for you no way
[01:03.04] So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
[01:05.59] At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
[01:09.49] The world needs wannabe's, ah
[01:13.75] So (Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing
[01:32.75] 
[01:17.54] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[01:19.61] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[01:23.03] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[01:26.46] And all the girls say I'm pretty fly (For a white guy)
[01:53.46] 
[01:30.25] He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
[01:32.55] But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
[01:35.60] Now cruising in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
[01:39.46] But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass
[02:06.46] 
[01:42.90] So don't debate, a player straight
[01:45.99] You know he really doesn't get it anyway
[01:49.26] He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
[01:52.78] For you no way, for you no way
[01:56.47] So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
[01:59.12] At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
[02:02.82] The world loves wannabe's, ah
[02:07.07] (Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing
[02:24.57] 
[02:10.06] Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah he's gettin' ink done
[02:12.95] He asked for a '13', but they drew a '31'
[02:16.17] Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip
[02:19.11] But in his own mind, he's the dopest trip
[02:39.61] 
[02:22.56] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[02:26.58] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[02:30.06] Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
[02:33.15] Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis
[02:54.15] 
[02:36.23] So don't debate, a player straight
[02:39.44] You know he really doesn't get it anyway
[02:42.90] He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
[02:46.08] For you no way, for you no way
[02:50.14] So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
[02:52.79] At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
[02:56.83] The world needs wannabe's, ah
[03:00.38] The world loves wannabe's
[03:03.51] So let's get some more wannabe's, ah
[03:07.36] (Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing
